# Project_Dust_ACI

## Overview
This repository contains the Python code used in our research for constructing a triple constraint framework involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Ice Water Path (IWP), and Dust Aerosol Optical Depth (DAOD). The primary objective of this framework is to decouple and analyze the nonlinear effects of dust and meteorological fields on high cloud properties. This approach is crucial for advancing our understanding of Aerosol-Cloud Interaction (ACI), particularly in the context of high clouds composed primarily of ice particles.

## Research Background
Our study, as detailed in our recent publication, addresses the complex interplay between meteorology and dust aerosols in the formation and evolution of high clouds. High clouds play a significant role in Earth's radiative balance, and their interaction with dust aerosols, especially as ice nucleating particles (INPs), is a key factor in climate prediction models. However, distinguishing the individual and combined effects of meteorological conditions and dust aerosols on high cloud properties has been a long-standing challenge.

Through our research, we employ PCA to extract the first principal component (PC1) as a significant meteorological indicator, which effectively constrains global high cloud evolution. By integrating PC1 with IWP and DAOD, we can separate the meteorological impacts from those of dust on high cloud properties. Our findings reveal that the strength of meteorological conditions significantly alters high cloud sensitivity to dust, providing new insights into the dynamics of ACI.

## Usage
The code in this repository is structured to facilitate replication and further exploration of our study's findings. Researchers and practitioners can use these scripts to apply our triple constraint framework to their datasets, enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear interactions between dust, meteorology, and high cloud properties.
